# home_insurance_premium_prediction
The goal of the study was to identify the best possible approach to predict the homeowner premium price using available insurance policy data, obtained from external website (Kaggle). Data was subject to exploration and visualization by making use of various plots and also subject to cleaning and preprocessing, where PCA analysis was involved. Five data mining techniques were involved with usage of 15 models in total, where a model from Multiple Linear regression appeared to be best among all with impressive accuracy and statistical measures. The model can further be improved by logarithmic transformations, reduced set of predictors and subset selection algorithms.

The applied data mining techniques are as follows:
1. Multiple linear regression
2. Random forest regression
3. Prediction using K- Nearest Neighbors
4. Neural Networks
5. Prediction using CART
